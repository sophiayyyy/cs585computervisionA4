Complicated Segmentation and Tracking

Problem Definition
The goal of this assignment is to deal with complicate segmentation and tracking items from frame to frame

For part 1, we should using some method to decrease the influence by background and then we can using skin detection to locate hands. For part 2, we first need a filter to predict the position of an object on next frame based on its positions on previous frames. And for each predicted position, we need to associate it with a real detected object in the next frame using some data association algorithm.
